<h1 id="about-me"> A Little Bit About Me... <img src="https://c.tenor.com/fbNST3YjMsAAAAAi/the-good-doggy.gif" width="100" ></h1>

My career background is people facing roles that focus heavily on communication, whereas in my free time I prefer to do less talking, spending it reading, playing video games and seeing musical theatre shows. I explored lots of different roles since leaving college and took my favourite things from each of them when I left: creativity, structure, fast-paced work and space for learning new things. I found all of this in software engineering. I chose coding because it's an outlet for creativity that I haven't found in previous roles, as well as being intellectually challenging. I love the problem solving aspect as it keeps me motivated and energetic.

***Communication*** <br/>
Communication, both written and verbal, has been at the centre of my career and education. In my previous role in human resources and recruitment, fantastic interpersonal skills were vital to my success in ensuring the entire company completed compliance courses. I regularly spoke with a range of people from graduates to the managing director both in the office and while working remotely to persuade them to complete the mandatory training. Adapting my communication style for the different audiences was a key part of this. I gamified the process using a scoreboard that showed each departments ranking, and used active listening techniques to ensure clarity in my conversations. As a result, the compliance completetion rate for the company went from around 60% to 95% in under a year. This really helped prepare me for Makers, as communication when pairing and working in teams has been really important in maintaining good working relationships and producing quality work.

***Time Management & Organisation*** <br/>
Throughout my time at Makers, I completed several group projects which, due to the tight time constraints, heavily relied on time management and organisational skills. Â During the Acebook project, I devised a time-boxed process that ensured we allocated appropriate resources to each debugging task, either as an individual or a team, and that no one person spent too long struggling with a task without asking for help. Furthermore, we used Trello boards when it came to prioritising features for our sprints. This allowed us to keep our stand-ups concise, as well as ensuring we could reach our goals by the end of the project.

***Teamwork*** <br/>
During my studies two friends and I founded an events company called Dreamrole Productions; teamwork was essential here as we were entering a relatively unknown industry and had to cover lots of ground. Being proactive about getting stuck in and stepping outside of our comfort zones allowed us to explore every aspect from the planning to the day of the event as a team. As in all good teams, we had a unique set of backgrounds and views that allowed us to harness a new creativity and put conflict resolution skills into practice. Due to developing our teamwork skills we ran six events, all profitable, over two years with over 175 participants. Teamwork has been fundamental in both my career and education, and I found it particularly useful when completing group coding projects at Makers. When faced with brand new tech that we weren't sure of having a proactive frame of mind was a necessity.
